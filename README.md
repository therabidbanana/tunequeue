What is it?
===========

A turntable.fm ripoff. Because turntable was way too buggy there for a few weeks, 
and is getting too restrictive to people that just want a sound track to
play with friends.

Tunequeue is a simple app for collaboratively building a playlist and listening to it. Songs are stored on S3,
and authentication done via Twitter. 

Since it's an exclusive members-only deal, we can be less restrictive than turntable.fm. People will be
able to download songs they hear, play the full albums from the same artist, etc. 


Obligatory Legal Stuff
======================

You install this on your own server - we are not responsible for what copyright laws you may or may 
not break with it. There is plenty of Creative Commons music you could legally listen to with this app. 
We do not encourage violating copyright law in any way.


Can I see it?
=============

If you're on the list already, yes. Otherwise, nope - you'll have to run it on your own server. 
It uses S3 to store and stream music, making it publicly available could get really expensive really quickly.
